# File-Streams-in-node
 This repository contains a mini work that demonstrates the use of file streams in Node.js. The project consists of an HTML file and a Node.js server. The HTML file contains a button that, when clicked, makes a fetch request to the Node.js server. The Node.js server then reads the contents of a file and sends it back to the client.
